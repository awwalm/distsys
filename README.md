# The Naïve Memory Benchmark
_**Demonstrating the basics of IPC (Inter-process Communication) techniques in distributed systems.**_

A C++ implementation and extension of Alexander Supalov's Naïve memory benchmark (initially written in C), visualized using Python.

- Program 1: One-way data transfer (data transfer in one direction from memory buffer1 to buffer2).
- Program 2: Two-way data transfer. (data transfer vice-versa from memory buffer1 to buffer2).
- Each of the programs autogenerates a series of Python code that visualizes the benchmark, which is not included in Supalov's work.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you may run the programs using **Code::Blocks** or an IDE/editor of your choice. 

### Prerequisistes
- **C++**: GNU GCC compiler, C++ 17 standard.
- **CygWin**: Terminal environment with important packages for managing GCC compilers.
- **Python**: Version 3.6 is used here with Matplotlib.
